This project is an attempt to make API Documentation easier and error free. Request parameters shall be validated
 with the documentation and responses as well. This way, documentation is kept up-to-date and responses are
 guaranteed to look like the documentation. This will decrease frustration from the frontend and increase
 reliability in the backend.
 
The API Documentation follows the [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/) and its latest [Specifications
 (v3.0.3)](http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3).
